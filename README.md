# Database-Management

This repo contains some of my work from the KTH course DD1368. The code was written to model and structure data according to actual constraints, to explain the implications of different constraints on the database structure, to use a query language to formulate queries and describe the mathematical foundation for query languages and to write embedded SQL statements in a third generation programming language
